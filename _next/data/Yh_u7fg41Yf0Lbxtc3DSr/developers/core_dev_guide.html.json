The core team appreciate the quality of\nyour work, and enjoy working with you; we have therefore invited you\nto join us.  Thank you for your numerous contributions to the project\nso far.</p>\n<p>You can see a list of all the current core developers on our\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/orgs/napari/teams/core-devs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@napari/core-devs</a>\nGitHub team. You should now be on that list too.</p>\n<p>This document offers guidelines for your new role.  First and\nforemost, you should familiarize yourself with the project’s\n<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../community/mission_and_values.html#mission-and-values\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">mission and values</span></a>.  When in\ndoubt, always refer back there.</p>\n<p>As a core team member, you gain the responsibility of shepherding\nother contributors through the review process; here are some\nguidelines for how to do that.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"all-contributors-are-treated-the-same\">\n<h2>All contributors are treated the same<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#all-contributors-are-treated-the-same\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>As a core developer, you gain the ability to merge or approve\nother contributors’ pull requests.  Much like nuclear launch keys, it\nis a shared power: you must merge <em>only after</em> another core has\napproved the pull request, <em>and</em> after you yourself have carefully\nreviewed it.  (See <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#reviewing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Reviewing</a> and especially\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#merge-only-changes-you-understand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Merge Only Changes You Understand</a> below.)\nIt should also be considered best practice to leave a reasonable (24hr) time window\nafter approval before merge to ensure that other core developers have a reasonable\nchance to weigh in.</p>\n<p>We are also an international community, with contributors from many different time zones,\nsome of whom will only contribute during their working hours, others who might only be able\nto contribute during nights and weekends. It is important to be respectful of other peoples\nschedules and working habits, even if it slows the project down slightly - we are in this\nfor the long run. In the same vein you also shouldn’t feel pressured to be constantly\navailable or online, and users or contributors who are overly demanding and unreasonable\nto the point of harassment will be directed to our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../community/code_of_conduct.html#napari-coc\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Code of Conduct</span></a>.\nWe value sustainable development practices over mad rushes.</p>\n<p>When merging, use GitHub’s\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/#merging-a-pull-request-on-github\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Squash and Merge</a>\nto ensure a clean git history.</p>\n<p>You should also continue to make your own pull requests as before and in accordance\nwith the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"contributing.html#napari-contributing\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">general contributor guide</span></a>. These pull requests still\nrequire the approval of another core developer before they can be merged.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"reviewing\">\n<h2>Reviewing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#reviewing\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"how-to-conduct-a-good-review\">\n<h3>How to conduct a good review<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-to-conduct-a-good-review\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p><em>Always</em> be kind to contributors. Contributors are often doing\nvolunteer work, for which we are tremendously grateful. Provide\nconstructive criticism on ideas and implementations, and remind\nyourself of how it felt when your own work was being evaluated as a\nnovice.</p>\n<p><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> strongly values mentorship in code review.  New users\noften need more handholding, having little to no git\nexperience. Repeat yourself liberally, and, if you don’t recognize a\ncontributor, point them to our development guide, or other GitHub\nworkflow tutorials around the web. Do not assume that they know how\nGitHub works (many don’t realize that adding a commit\nautomatically updates a pull request, for example). Gentle, polite, kind\nencouragement can make the difference between a new core developer and\nan abandoned pull request.</p>\n<p>When reviewing, focus on the following:</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><strong>Usability and generality:</strong> <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> is a GUI application that strives to be accessible\nto both coding and non-coding users, and new features should ultimately be\naccessible to everyone using the app. <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> targets the scientific user\ncommunity broadly, and core features should be domain-agnostic and general purpose.\nCustom functionality is meant to be provided through our plugin ecosystem. If in doubt,\nconsult back with our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../community/mission_and_values.html#mission-and-values\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">mission and values</span></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Performance and benchmarks:</strong> As <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> targets scientific applications that often involve\nlarge multidimensional datasets, high performance is a key value of <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code>. While\nevery new feature won’t scale equally to all sizes of data, keeping in mind performance\nand our <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"benchmarks.html#napari-benchmarks\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">benchmarks</span></a> during a review may be important, and you may\nneed to ask for benchmarks to be run and reported or new benchmarks to be added.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>APIs and stability:</strong> Coding users and plugin developers will make\nextensive use of our APIs. The foundation of a healthy plugin ecosystem will be\na fully capable and stable set of APIs, so as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> matures it will\nvery important to ensure our APIs are stable. For now, while the project is still\nin an earlier stage, spending the extra time to consider names of public facing\nvariables and methods, along side function signatures, could save us considerable\ntrouble in the future. Right now we are still making breaking changes with minor\nversion numbers <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">0.x</span></code> and do not have a deprecation policy, but we will work to add one soon.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Documentation and tutorials:</strong> All new methods should have appropriate doc\nstrings following <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP257</a> and the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html#documentation-style\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NumPy documentation guide</a>.\nFor any major new features, accompanying changes should be made to our\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://napari.org/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tutorials</a>. These should not only\nillustrates the new feature, but explains it. Titles for all documents in napari should follow <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sentence case capitalization</a>, but the name <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">napari</span></code> should always be written in lowercase.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Implementations and algorithms:</strong> You should understand the code being modified\nor added before approving it.  (See <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#merge-only-changes-you-understand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Merge Only Changes You Understand</a>\nbelow.) Implementations should do what they claim and be simple, readable, and efficient\nin that order.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tests:</strong> All contributions <em>must</em> be tested, and each added line of code\nshould be covered by at least one test. Good tests not only execute the code,\nbut explore corner cases.  It can be tempting not to review tests, but please\ndo so.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other changes may be <em>nitpicky</em>: spelling mistakes, formatting,\netc. Do not insist contributors make these changes, but instead you should offer\nto make these changes by <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pushing to their branch</a>, or using GitHub’s <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">suggestion</a>\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">feature</a>, and\nbe prepared to make them yourself if needed. Using the suggestion feature is preferred because\nit gives the contributor a choice in whether to accept the changes.</p>\n<p>Unless you know that a contributor is experienced with git, don’t\nask for a rebase when merge conflicts arise. Instead, rebase the\nbranch yourself, force-push to their branch, and advise the contributor to force-pull.  If the contributor is\nno longer active, you may take over their branch by submitting a new pull\nrequest and closing the original, including a reference to the original pull\nrequest. In doing so, ensure you communicate that you are not throwing the\ncontributor’s work away!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"merge-only-changes-you-understand\">\n<h3>Merge only changes you understand<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#merge-only-changes-you-understand\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<p><em>Long-term maintainability</em> is an important concern.  Code doesn’t\nmerely have to <em>work</em>, but should be <em>understood</em> by multiple core\ndevelopers.  Changes will have to be made in the future, and the\noriginal contributor may have moved on.</p>\n<p>Therefore, <em>do not merge a code change unless you understand it</em>. Ask\nfor help freely: we can consult community members, or even external developers,\nfor added insight where needed, and see this as a great learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>While we collectively “own” any patches (and bugs!) that become part\nof the code base, you are vouching for changes you merge.
