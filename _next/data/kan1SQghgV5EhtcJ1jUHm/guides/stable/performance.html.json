user has to wait\nfor a result, however with an interactive tool like napari performance is even\nmore critical. Therefore performance is a core feature of napari.</p>\n<p>Inadequate performance will leave the user frustrated and discouraged and they\nwill migrate to other tools or simply give up on interactive exploration of\ntheir data altogether. In contrast, excellent performance will create a joyful\nexperience that encourages longer and more intensive exploration, yielding\nbetter scientific results.</p>\n<p>There are two main types of performance:</p>\n<ol class=\"simple\">\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#objective-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Objective Performance</a></p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>How long operations take when timed with a stopwatch.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most times will vary based on the data being viewed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"#subjective-performance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Subjective Performance</a></p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>The user’s experience as it relates to performance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the user’s experience pleasant or frustrating? Does napari “seem fast”?</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both types of performance are important. No amount of slickness can make up for\nan application that is fundamentally too slow. And even a relatively fast\napplication can feel clunky or frustrating if not designed well.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"objective-performance\">\n<h2>Objective Performance<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#objective-performance\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>How to keep napari objectively fast:</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"focus-on-real-use-cases\">\n<h3>Focus On Real Use Cases<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#focus-on-real-use-cases\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Focus on cases that matter to lots of people.</p></li>\n<li><p>It’s easy to waste time optimizing things no one cares about or no one will\nnotice.</p></li>\n<li><p>If a dataset is unreasonable or out of scope or fringe, don’t spend too\nmany resources trying to make it run fast.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"always-be-timing\">\n<h3>Always Be Timing<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#always-be-timing\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Build timers into the software that always run.</p></li>\n<li><p>If not always visible, power users and developers should be able to toggle them on.</p></li>\n<li><p>This gives people an ambient awareness of how long things take.</p></li>\n<li><p>Allows users to report concrete performance numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>it seemed slow</em> → <em>it ran at 10Hz</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>it took a long time</em> → <em>it took 2 minutes and 30 seconds</em>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Teaches users how different hardware impacts performance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For example seek times with SSD are radically faster than HDD.</p></li>\n<li><p>Become familiar with the impact of local vs. networked file systems.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"performance-system-tests\">\n<h3>Performance System Tests<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#performance-system-tests\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Create automatic tests that time specific operations in specific known datasets.</p></li>\n<li><p>Time many different operations on a nice selection of different datasets.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"performance-unit-tests\">\n<h3>Performance Unit Tests<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#performance-unit-tests\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Time one small operation to monitor for regressions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Napari has some of these today as “benchmarks”.</p></li>\n<li><p>Interesting to see how different hardware performs as time goes on.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"run-all-tests-every-merge\">\n<h3>Run All Tests Every Merge<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#run-all-tests-every-merge\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Save results to a database maybe using <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ASV</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Catch a regression right when it happens and not weeks or\nmonths later.</p></li>\n<li><p>See how new features run on large datasets no one tested.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"subjective-performance\">\n<h2>Subjective Performance<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#subjective-performance\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h2>\n<p>Napari should strive to have these properties:</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"responsive\">\n<h3>Responsive<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#responsive\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>React to input one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The full operation happens right away.</p></li>\n<li><p>The interface clearly indicates the input was received and the operation was\nstarted.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>For click or keypress events the <strong>ideal response is 100ms</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>For drag events or animations the <strong>ideal refresh is 60Hz</strong> which is 16.7ms per\nframe.</p></li>\n<li><p>The UI should never seem dead, the user should never be left wondering if\nnapari has crashed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"interruptible\">\n<h3>Interruptible<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#interruptible\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h3>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Modeless operations are best.
